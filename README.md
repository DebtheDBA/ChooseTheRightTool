# ChooseTheRightTool
Repo for session: "Choosing the Right Tool for the Job"

## Abstract:
There’s a saying about using the right tool for the right job. After all, you don’t want to use a hammer when you need a screwdriver. We have many tools available to us to do our job as data professionals - some work better as development tools and other for admin tasks while some can handle either. So how do you decide which to use when?

In this session we’ll cover the most commonly used tools. We’ll look at where they work well and when we may need to look for a different tool. We’ll discuss areas where the tools intersect and work directly with each other. Some of the tools we will look at include Management Studio, Azure Data Studio, and Plan Explorer.

At the end, you should be able to go back to work with a better understanding of the tools available to us, when to use them, and how they can make your job easier to do.
